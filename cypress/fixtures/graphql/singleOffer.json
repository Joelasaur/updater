Please be aware that due to Ethernet overhead on a 1G link, actual speeds might be limited to 940 Megabytes per second.\nCPU: Intel Dual Core i5 2.5GHz or better or AMD Dual Core K10 2.5GHz or better\nOS Requirements: Windows 8.1 (64 bit) or newer or Mac OSX 10.8 or newer\nMemory: 8 GB\nHard Drive: SSD recommended to achieve maximum download speeds\nHard Drive Space: 64 GB or larger\nMac OSX Browsers: Safari 6.2.8 or newer or Firefox 40.0.3 or newer or Chrome 44.0.2403 or newer\nWindows Browsers: IE 11 or newer; MS Edge browser (Windows 10); Firefox 40.0.3 or newer; Chrome 44.0.2403 or newer\nExample machines: Dell Latitude E7450, 2013 Macbook Pro\nIf you have hardware, software and related equipment configurations that can connect to the Internet but that are different from the above recommendations, they will still work with your Xfinity Internet service; however, our testing has shown that these recommendations will work best to achieve your provisioned broadband speed. If you are not experiencing the speeds you expect, remember to test using a hardwired connection to the Internet. Also, make sure you are not in the process of downloading or uploading anything, close all programs using the Internet and power off any other devices that are sharing your home network. Remember, there are a number of external factors that may limit your speed; as a result, actual speeds may vary. For best performance, contact your device manufacturer/software provider for required upgrades, configuration updates, or troubleshooting guides.",
